# Week 3 – SQL Assignment: Subqueries, CTEs, and Window Functions

## Objective
Analyze sales data from the "Superstore dataset" using subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.

---

## Step 1: Setup
- setup.sql - Database + staging + normalized tables
  - `superstore_raw` - raw imported data  
  - `customers` - customer details  
  - `orders` - order details  
  - `products` - product details  

Meaning: Prepare clean tables for analysis.

---

## Step 2: Queries
- queries.sql - Required analysis queries

1. Orders above average sales - Meaning: High‑value orders  
2. Highest sales order per customer - Meaning: Biggest purchase per customer  
3. Total sales per customer (CTE) - Meaning: Aggregate spend per customer  
4. Customers above average sales (CTE + Subquery) - Meaning: Higher‑than‑average spenders  
5. Rank customers by sales (Window Function) - Meaning: Rank customers by spend  
6. Row numbers per order within customer - Meaning: Sequence orders per customer  
7. Top 3 customers - Meaning: Three highest spenders  

---

## Step 3: Final Insights
- final.sql - Combined query + mini project

1. Final Combined Query - Meaning: Customer name, total sales, rank  
2. Top 5 customers - Meaning: Five highest spenders  
3. Bottom 5 customers - Meaning: Five lowest spenders  
4. Customers with one order - Meaning: One‑time buyers  
5. Customers above average sales - Meaning: Higher‑than‑average spenders  
6. Highest order per customer - Meaning: Largest single order per customer
