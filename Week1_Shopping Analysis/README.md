#Basic Data Exploration and Cleaning using Pandas

-Objective

The objective of this project is to perform basic data exploration and data cleaning using the Pandas library in Python. The project demonstrates loading a dataset, understanding its structure, handling missing values, removing duplicate records, performing basic data operations, creating derived features, generating visualizations, and exporting a cleaned dataset for further analysis.

-Dataset Used

File: Combined_dataset.csv

The dataset contains product-level information including pricing, ratings, brand details, discounts, category, and other attributes related to an e-commerce shopping platform.


-Libraries Used

pandas — Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
numpy — Numerical operations
matplotlib — Plotting and visualization
seaborn — Statistical data visualization

Project Workflow

1. Load Dataset

The CSV file was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv().

pythondf = pd.read_csv(file_path)

Column names were standardized by converting them to lowercase and removing extra whitespace.

2. Data Exploration

The following exploratory operations were performed:

Displayed first five rows using head()
Displayed last five rows using tail()
Checked dataset dimensions using shape
Listed all column names
Inspected data types using dtypes
Generated dataset information using info()
Produced descriptive statistics using describe(include='all')

These steps helped in understanding the structure, data types, and overall quality of the data.


3. Missing Value Analysis

Missing values were identified using:

pythondf.isnull().sum()

Actions performed:

Removed completely empty rows using dropna(how='all')
Filled missing numeric values with the column median
Filled missing text or categorical values with "Unknown"

This ensured data consistency without losing excessive information.


4. Duplicate Removal

Duplicate records were identified using:

pythondf.duplicated().sum()

All duplicates were removed using:

pythondf.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

This improved data quality and prevented redundant records from skewing analysis results.


5. Convert Columns to Numeric

Price-related and rating columns were explicitly converted to numeric format to handle any string formatting or special characters present in the raw data:

pythondf[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col].astype(str).str.replace(r'[^0-9.\-]', '', regex=True), errors='coerce')

Columns converted: initial_price, discount, final_price, rating, ratings_count


6. Basic Data Operations

Row Filtering

Products with a final price greater than 1000 were filtered:

pythonexpensive_products = df[df['final_price'] > 1000]

Column Selection

Relevant columns were selected for focused analysis:

pythonselected_cols = ['title', 'category', 'initial_price', 'final_price', 'rating', 'ratings_count']


7. Feature Engineering

Three new derived columns were created.

a. Price Difference

Represents the discount amount saved by the customer:

pythondf['price_difference'] = df['initial_price'] - df['final_price']

b. Popularity Score

A metric combining rating and number of ratings to measure overall product popularity:

pythondf['popularity'] = df['rating'] * df['ratings_count']

c. Total Amount

Represents total value of a product order calculated as price multiplied by quantity:

pythondf['total_amount'] = df['final_price'] * df['quantity']

Note: If the dataset does not contain a quantity column, total_amount defaults to final_price as a fallback.


8. Analysis

Univariate Analysis

Individual column statistics were computed for final_price and rating using .describe() to understand distribution, mean, and spread of each variable.

Bivariate Analysis

Correlation between final_price and rating was calculated using .corr() to understand whether higher-priced products tend to receive better or worse ratings.

Category-Level Analysis

Average final price was computed per category and sorted in descending order to identify high-value product segments:

pythondf.groupby('category')['final_price'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)


9. Visualizations

The following plots were created to represent trends and patterns in the data:


Histogram of final_price to show the distribution of product prices
Boxplot of final_price to detect price outliers
Bar Chart of average final_price per category to compare categories by price
Scatter Plot of final_price vs rating to visualize the relationship between price and rating



10. Key Insights


Top 10 categories by product count were identified
Average and maximum final price were computed across all products
Average rating across all products was computed
Total revenue was estimated using the total_amount column
Average saving per product was computed using price_difference


11. Business Implications

Pricing Strategy — High-priced categories should be prioritized for seasonal discount campaigns to drive volume without heavy margin loss.
Product Recommendations — Products with high popularity scores are strong candidates for homepage featuring and search ranking boosts.
Discount Management — Large price differences between initial and final price indicate aggressive discounting. These SKUs should be monitored for profit margin erosion over time.
Quality Control — Categories or products with consistently low ratings need supplier review, quality checks, or should be delisted to protect brand trust.
Inventory Planning — The total_amount column reveals which products drive the most revenue. High total amount products should maintain strong stock availability.
Premium Segment Targeting — Categories with few products but high average price represent premium segments. These need targeted marketing rather than broad discount offers.


12. Export Cleaned Dataset

The final cleaned and enriched dataset was exported using:

pythondf.to_csv(output_path, index=False)

Output file: Cleaned_Combined_dataset.csv


Output Files


Data_CLEANING AND Exploration.ipynb — Complete Jupyter Notebook with all code and outputs
Cleaned_Combined_dataset.csv — Final cleaned and feature-engineered dataset
README.md — Project documentation


Final Dataset Summary

Missing values remaining: 0
Duplicate rows remaining: 0
New columns added: price_difference, popularity, total_amount


Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates fundamental Pandas operations including data loading, exploration, type conversion, missing value handling, duplicate removal, row filtering, column selection, feature engineering, statistical analysis, visualization, and data export. Business implications were derived from the cleaned data to demonstrate real-world applicability. The final cleaned dataset is ready for further analysis, modelling, or dashboard integration.
